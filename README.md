To work with branches:

1. Create branch of your name in the branches settings (can do on github website)
2. from your local device/terminal/VSCode:
    use "git checkout <yourname>" to switch to your branch
    use "git pull" to ensure your branch is up to date
    use "git push" from your branch to save local changes
    navigate to main using "git checkout main"
    use "git merge <yourname>" to update the main branch with the changes from your branch

After these steps/using these commands, your branch should show 0 steps behind and 0 steps ahead of main.
